Not just because of the engagement, but because it holds you accountable and pushes you, even on days you don't want to. And today, I think I need that a little bit more than I did before.\n\nSo, here goes, I'm going to post more regularly on here, because I think it will help me hold myself accountable to do the necessary work every day, even on bad days where 'necessary' could very well mean 'bare minimum,' or on good days were it could mean 'above and beyond.' I also just want to connect with people and maybe make someone laugh every now and then.\n\nAnd to make myself more excited to do this, I'm not going to treat it like a corporate email chain, or a memo to my boss. I'll post genuinely, honestly, and authentically. And you can bet I'll absolutely be cutting the BS, because like I said, I absolutely despise it.\n\nHere's to the job search, the grind, the failures, the headaches, the OBNOXIOUS LinkedIn posts, and hopefully the eventual successes."], ["title", "A LinkedIn Rant"], ["image", "https://www.squiresgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Mar-20-blog-2-LinkedIn-recommendations-002.jpg"], ["post_date", "2023-02-20 18:38:43"], ["created_at", "2023-02-28 15:41:06.298532"], ["updated_at", "2023-02-28 15:41:06.298532"]]

And today, I think I need that a little bit more than I did before.\n\nSo, here goes, I'm going to post more regularly on here, because I think it will help me hold myself accountable to do the necessary work every day, even on bad days where 'necessary' could very well mean 'bare minimum,' or on good days were it could mean 'above and beyond.' I also just want to connect with people and maybe make someone laugh every now and then.\n\nAnd to make myself more excited to do this, I'm not going to treat it like a corporate email chain, or a memo to my boss.

Not just because of the engagement, but because it holds you accountable and pushes you, even on days you don't want to. And today, I think I need that a little bit more than I did before.\n\nSo, here goes, I'm going to post more regularly on here, because I think it will help me hold myself accountable to do the necessary work every day, even on bad days where 'necessary' could very well mean 'bare minimum,' or on good days were it could mean 'above and beyond.' I also just want to connect with people and maybe make someone laugh every now and then.\n\nAnd to make myself more excited to do this, I'm not going to treat it like a corporate email chain, or a memo to my boss. I'll post genuinely, honestly, and authentically.

And rightfully so, this is a more professional space than a site like Twitter.

Not just because of the engagement, but because it holds you accountable and pushes you, even on days you don't want to. And today, I think I need that a little bit more than I did before.\n\nSo, here goes, I'm going to post more regularly on here, because I think it will help me hold myself accountable to do the necessary work every day, even on bad days where 'necessary' could very well mean 'bare minimum,' or on good days were it could mean 'above and beyond.' I also just want to connect with people and maybe make someone laugh every now and then.\n\nAnd to make myself more excited to do this, I'm not going to treat it like a corporate email chain, or a memo to my boss. I'll post genuinely, honestly, and authentically.

And rightfully so, this is a more professional space than a site like Twitter.

Not just because of the engagement, but because it holds you accountable and pushes you, even on days you don't want to. And today, I think I need that a little bit more than I did before.\n\nSo, here goes, I'm going to post more regularly on here, because I think it will help me hold myself accountable to do the necessary work every day, even on bad days where 'necessary' could very well mean 'bare minimum,' or on good days were it could mean 'above and beyond.' I also just want to connect with people and maybe make someone laugh every now and then.\n\nAnd to make myself more excited to do this, I'm not going to treat it like a corporate email chain, or a memo to my boss. I'll post genuinely, honestly, and authentically.

Not just because of the engagement, but because it holds you accountable and pushes you, even on days you don't want to. And today, I think I need that a little bit more than I did before.\n\nSo, here goes, I'm going to post more regularly on here, because I think it will help me hold myself accountable to do the necessary work every day, even on bad days where 'necessary' could very well mean 'bare minimum,' or on good days were it could mean 'above and beyond.' I also just want to connect with people and maybe make someone laugh every now and then.\n\nAnd to make myself more excited to do this, I'm not going to treat it like a corporate email chain, or a memo to my boss. I'll post genuinely, honestly, and authentically.

And rightfully so, this is a more professional space than a site like Twitter. But because of this spite, I have avoided posting on here and putting my professional persona out there.\n\nRecently, I have begun to realize how important it is to regularly post on LinkedIn. Not just because of the engagement, but because it holds you accountable and pushes you, even on days you don't want to. And today, I think I need that a little bit more than I did before.\n\nSo, here goes, I'm going to post more regularly on here, because I think it will help me hold myself accountable to do the necessary work every day, even on bad days where 'necessary' could very well mean 'bare minimum,' or on good days were it could mean 'above and beyond.'

And rightfully so, this is a more professional space than a site like Twitter. But because of this spite, I have avoided posting on here and putting my professional persona out there.\n\nRecently, I have begun to realize how important it is to regularly post on LinkedIn. Not just because of the engagement, but because it holds you accountable and pushes you, even on days you don't want to. And today, I think I need that a little bit more than I did before.\n\nSo, here goes, I'm going to post more regularly on here, because I think it will help me hold myself accountable to do the necessary work every day, even on bad days where 'necessary' could very well mean 'bare minimum,' or on good days were it could mean 'above and beyond.' I also just want to connect with people and maybe make someone laugh every now and then.\n\nAnd to make myself more excited to do this, I'm not going to treat it like a corporate email chain, or a memo to my boss. I'll post genuinely, honestly, and authentically. And you can bet I'll absolutely be cutting the BS, because like I said, I absolutely despise it.\n\nHere's to the job search, the grind, the failures, the headaches, the OBNOXIOUS LinkedIn posts, and hopefully the eventual successes."], ["title", "A LinkedIn Rant"], ["image", "https://www.squiresgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Mar-20-blog-2-LinkedIn-recommendations-002.jpg"], ["post_date", "2023-02-20 18:38:43"], ["created_at", "2023-03-27 16:41:41.925577"], ["updated_at", "2023-03-27 16:41:41.925577"], ["category", "Coding"]]

And rightfully so, this is a more professional space than a site like Twitter. But because of this spite, I have avoided posting on here and putting my professional persona out there.\n\nRecently, I have begun to realize how important it is to regularly post on LinkedIn. Not just because of the engagement, but because it holds you accountable and pushes you, even on days you don't want to. And today, I think I need that a little bit more than I did before.\n\nSo, here goes, I'm going to post more regularly on here, because I think it will help me hold myself accountable to do the necessary work every day, even on bad days where 'necessary' could very well mean 'bare minimum,' or on good days were it could mean 'above and beyond.' I also just want to connect with people and maybe make someone laugh every now and then.\n\nAnd to make myself more excited to do this, I'm not going to treat it like a corporate email chain, or a memo to my boss. I'll post genuinely, honestly, and authentically. And you can bet I'll absolutely be cutting the BS, because like I said, I absolutely despise it.\n\nHere's to the job search, the grind, the failures, the headaches, the OBNOXIOUS LinkedIn posts, and hopefully the eventual successes."], ["title", "A LinkedIn Rant"], ["image", "https://www.squiresgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Mar-20-blog-2-LinkedIn-recommendations-002.jpg"], ["post_date", "2023-02-20 18:38:43"], ["created_at", "2023-03-27 16:44:52.903172"], ["updated_at", "2023-03-27 16:44:52.903172"], ["category", "Coding"]]

Not just because of the engagement, but because it holds you accountable and pushes you, even on days you don't want to. And today, I think I need that a little bit more than I did before.\n\nSo, here goes, I'm going to post more regularly on here, because I think it will help me hold myself accountable to do the necessary work every day, even on bad days where 'necessary' could very well mean 'bare minimum,' or on good days were it could mean 'above and beyond.' I also just want to connect with people and maybe make someone laugh every now and then.\n\nAnd to make myself more excited to do this, I'm not going to treat it like a corporate email chain, or a memo to my boss. I'll post genuinely, honestly, and authentically.

Not just because of the engagement, but because it holds you accountable and pushes you, even on days you don't want to. And today, I think I need that a little bit more than I did before.\n\nSo, here goes, I'm going to post more regularly on here, because I think it will help me hold myself accountable to do the necessary work every day, even on bad days where 'necessary' could very well mean 'bare minimum,' or on good days were it could mean 'above and beyond.' I also just want to connect with people and maybe make someone laugh every now and then.\n\nAnd to make myself more excited to do this, I'm not going to treat it like a corporate email chain, or a memo to my boss. I'll post genuinely, honestly, and authentically.

Not just because of the engagement, but because it holds you accountable and pushes you, even on days you don't want to. And today, I think I need that a little bit more than I did before.\n\nSo, here goes, I'm going to post more regularly on here, because I think it will help me hold myself accountable to do the necessary work every day, even on bad days where 'necessary' could very well mean 'bare minimum,' or on good days were it could mean 'above and beyond.' I also just want to connect with people and maybe make someone laugh every now and then.\n\nAnd to make myself more excited to do this, I'm not going to treat it like a corporate email chain, or a memo to my boss. I'll post genuinely, honestly, and authentically.

Not just because of the engagement, but because it holds you accountable and pushes you, even on days you don't want to. And today, I think I need that a little bit more than I did before.\n\nSo, here goes, I'm going to post more regularly on here, because I think it will help me hold myself accountable to do the necessary work every day, even on bad days where 'necessary' could very well mean 'bare minimum,' or on good days were it could mean 'above and beyond.' I also just want to connect with people and maybe make someone laugh every now and then.\n\nAnd to make myself more excited to do this, I'm not going to treat it like a corporate email chain, or a memo to my boss. I'll post genuinely, honestly, and authentically.

Not just because of the engagement, but because it holds you accountable and pushes you, even on days you don't want to. And today, I think I need that a little bit more than I did before.\n\nSo, here goes, I'm going to post more regularly on here, because I think it will help me hold myself accountable to do the necessary work every day, even on bad days where 'necessary' could very well mean 'bare minimum,' or on good days were it could mean 'above and beyond.' I also just want to connect with people and maybe make someone laugh every now and then.\n\nAnd to make myself more excited to do this, I'm not going to treat it like a corporate email chain, or a memo to my boss. I'll post genuinely, honestly, and authentically.
